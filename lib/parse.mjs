/**
 * Adaptive cash-bid table parser.
 *
 * Written to survive layout churn on hosted elevator bid boards, where the
 * tables are server-rendered but the exact markup, column order and class
 * names differ per site and change when the host re-themes.
 *
 * Big River's board is FarmCentric: the page pulls portal.farmcentric.com and
 * its classes are fcControls*. It is NOT AgriCharts and NOT Barchart. An
 * earlier session asserted AgriCharts on nothing but co-occurrence in search
 * results, was asked "are u sure", and was wrong. This header said AgriCharts
 * for weeks after the rest of the kit was corrected. Do not reintroduce a
 * vendor name here that has not been read off the page itself.
 *
 * Strategy: find every <table> (including ones nested inside layout tables),
 * score each on whether its header row looks like a cash-bid table, then map
 * columns by header TEXT rather than by position. Nothing here depends on
 * class names, ids, or column order.
 *
 * Pure ES module with no dependencies, so the test suite exercises exactly the
 * code that runs in the job.

 *
 * THE MAGNITUDE HEURISTIC HAD A CLIFF AT THREE DOLLARS -- 2026-08-20.
 *
 * The old rule was magnitude alone: under 3 means dollars, 3 or over means
 * cents. New-crop soybean basis reaches minus three dollars in a weak market,
 * and on the day it crosses that line the published figure changes by 100x:
 *
 *     -2.99  ->  -299     correct
 *     -3.00  ->     -3    wrong, and the row before it on the same board is right
 *
 * Nothing downstream could see it. `checkIdentity` reads `basis` in DOLLARS,
 * so cash - basis = futures still balances on a row whose published
 * `basisCents` is out by a factor of a hundred, and `basisCents` is what the
 * Emmert sites render.
 *
 * So decide on the TEXT, which is what actually carries the unit: a board
 * quoting dollars writes a decimal point ("-0.52", "-.35", "-3.0500"), a board
 * quoting cents writes a bare integer ("-52"). The magnitude rule is kept only
 * for callers that have no text to offer, and `checkBasisUnits` in board.mjs
 * now cross-checks the result against cash and the futures quote, so a unit
 * error can no longer publish however it got here.

 *
 * Two rows quoting Mar 27 corn at 513-6s were read as 513, the identity came
 * out 0.75c short, and the reader refused a board that was entirely correct.
 * Every run after the 1:20pm settle failed the same way, the feed froze at
 * 18:16Z, and both Emmert sites were eleven hours from withdrawing a price.
 *
 * WHY IT HID. The truncation is invisible whenever a contract settles on a
 * whole cent: "473-0s" and "498-0s" parse to 473 and 498, which are the right
 * answers, by luck. It shows only on a contract settling on an eighth, and
 * only after 1:20pm Central. On 2026-08-19 Sep 26 and Dec 26 settled flat
 * while Mar 27 settled 513-6 -- which is why exactly two of seven rows failed,
 * and why the diagnosis kept coming back as "their board disagrees with
 * itself". It did not. We were reading it wrong.

 * only check here that proves we read the RIGHT COLUMNS rather than merely
 * plausible numbers. The sanity band, the max-move rail and the freshness gate
 * all test whether a value looks reasonable. None of them notices a page that
 * quietly reordered its columns while every value stayed in range.
 *
 * Verified against the real Boyceville capture: agrees to four decimals on all
 * seven rows.
 *
 * UNITS. cash and basis are DOLLARS. futuresPrice is CENTS, because parseTicks
 * reads "459-4" as 459.5 cents. Getting that backwards makes this pass on
 * everything, which is worse than not having it.
 *
 * TOLERANCE. One eighth of a cent is 0.125c, so the tolerance has to sit below
 * that or a one-eighth misread slips through. 0.05c leaves room for float noise
 * and nothing else.
