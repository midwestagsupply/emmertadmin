 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: the boundaries. Every input that was refused before is
 * refused now and every input that published before still publishes. The name
 * and the message were wrong; the decision was right. Pinned by test.

 * accepts a residual in either direction and of any size up to the limit.
 *
 * Some boards round in a way we can state exactly. DTN Content Services is one.
 * Measured across 25 records captured live at Ag Partners on 2026-08-20:
 *
 *     cash == basis + futures exactly      4 of 25
 *     cash == ROUND(basis + futures)      11 of 25
 *     cash == FLOOR(basis + futures)      25 of 25
 *
 * and the only residuals present are 0, 0.25 and 0.75 cents — the eighths
 * remainder of their own futures quote, never anything else. Their cash cell is
 * the arithmetic TRUNCATED to the cent, always in the farmer's disfavour by
 * less than a cent, which is exactly what a grain buyer would do.
 *
 * So instead of handing this platform a three-quarter-cent tolerance and hoping,
 * state the rule: the residual must be at least zero and strictly less than one
 * cent. That is DIRECTIONAL and BOUNDED, so it is strictly stronger than
 * `cashRoundingCents: 0.75` — a board whose cash reads a cent HIGH than the
 * arithmetic still fails, and so does every column shift, which moves things by

     WHERE THIS MODE'S EVIDENCE ACTUALLY COMES FROM -- corrected 2026-09-07.
     This comment used to credit Premier Cooperative: "found 2026-08-20 by
     running the probe against their page, 161 of 161 rows, residuals
     {-0.5,-0.25,0,+0.25}, floor explained only 89". That measurement was an
     artefact of the probe, not a fact about Premier. Their boards post cash
     BELOW the cent -- 5.1175 -- and reconcile to the last digit: measured
     2026-09-07 across the live shards, Manchester 17 of 17, Ossian 16 of 16,
     Postville 15 of 15, Viserion McGregor 18 of 18, 145 rows over twelve
     locations with a residual of zero on every one. The old counter rounded
     cash to the cent before measuring it, and rounding a quarter down, a
     three-quarter up and a half up is precisely how {-0.5,-0.25,0,+0.25} is
     manufactured out of nothing. See lib/rounding.mjs.

     The mode itself stands, on evidence gathered a different way: the
     AgriCharts cashgrid boards, 6,228 testable rows across 45 captured boards
     on 2026-09-04, measured through checkIdentity -- which does not round --
     and reported in the note below. Nothing here is widened or narrowed by the
     correction; a rule was being justified by the wrong measurement and now
     names the right one. */
  /* HALF ROUNDS UP, so the window is closed at the bottom and OPEN at the top.
     A residual of exactly +0.5 would mean their cash cell rounded DOWN from a
     half, which round-half-up never does -- the arithmetic would have produced
     the next cent up and the residual would read -0.5 instead. Premier's 161
     rows show -0.5 and never +0.5, which is that asymmetry visible in the data.
     Closing this interval at both ends would also put the guard half a cent

   * and describing it as if it did is what refused CoMark's KC wheat.
   *
   * AND WHETHER A BOARD SHOWS +0.5 IS A PROPERTY OF THE DAY, NOT THE BOARD.
   * +0.5 occurs only when basis + futures lands exactly on a half-cent, which

   * different board. It is not an outlier. It is the boundary, and it must be
   * closed or every cashgrid board refuses on the days the arithmetic lands
   * on a half.
   *
   * Closed is still bounded and still strictly weaker than nothing: a moved
   * column is tens of cents. Premier keeps `round-cent`, so the boundary this

   *
   *     Old Crop | 4.57 | -0.80 | 5.3675s | -4.00 | Dec 26 Corn
   *
   * so the derived value is a whole number of cents by construction while the
   * quote sits on the quarter-cent grid the contract actually trades on. The
   * residual is therefore not noise and not a rounding CHOICE by the buyer --
   * it is the part of the quote the two-decimal columns cannot show.
   *
   * THE BOUND IS DERIVED, NOT FITTED. A cash cell displayed to the cent is
   * within half a cent of the true figure, and so is a basis cell. Their
   * difference is therefore within a full cent of the truth, and strictly
   * within it: the residual lies in (-1, +1), open at both ends, because
   * landing on exactly a cent would mean both columns were rounded a full half
   * in the same direction, which is the next cent along.
   *
   * MEASURED before it was written, across the eleven captured
   * dollars-quoting boards (fixtures/board-sweep/cashbidssingle-*.html plus
   * fixtures/ace-3578.html), 216 testable rows read with futuresUnits

   *
   * plus three rows out by ~70,000c, which are Berthold's canola quoted per
   * tonne against a per-hundredweight cash bid and are NOT this. Every
   * residual this mode is meant to cover falls inside the derived bound and
   * the widest, +0.75, is a row where the basis cell is doing the rounding
   * (4.75 - -0.80 shown, 5.5575 quoted).
   *
   * WHY THIS IS NOT round-cent-either WIDENED. round-cent-either describes a
   * board that ROUNDS its cash to the nearest cent, half either way. This
   * describes a board where cash and basis are each displayed to the cent and
   * the arithmetic is done on the figures behind them -- two roundings, not
   * one, and their errors add. Naming it separately keeps the +0.75 row from
   * being smuggled into a mode whose own evidence says it never produces one.
   *
   * IT IS STILL A GUARD. A moved column moves a price by tens or hundreds of
   * cents; a wrong futuresUnits by a hundredfold. One cent reaches neither,
   * and the three canola rows above prove it in this very corpus: they are
   * refused by this mode exactly as they were before it existed. */

/* WHAT THE BOARD CALLS THE CONTRACT ITS CASH PRICE IS BASIS TO.
 *
 * Scoular's 36 boards write their commodities as trade abbreviations -- Yc,
 * Ysb, Hww, Sor, Bly -- and on 2026-09-04 twenty of the twenty-three manifests
 * the board sweep wrote carried at least one name that matched no band. Every
 * one of those rows would have been withheld at the first poll.
 *
 * I know what Yc means. Typing that in is exactly the move this project has
 * decided against, because the next person cannot tell what was measured from
 * what was remembered -- and "Bly" would be a guess dressed up as a fact.
 *
 * THE ROW ITSELF SAYS, IN THE NEXT COLUMN ALONG. A cash bid quotes the futures
 * contract it is basis to, and the identity check already requires that column
 * to reconcile to a fraction of a cent: cash - basis = futures. So the futures
 * column is not decoration, it is the same board's own statement of what this
 * row is -- and it is spelled out. Measured on the boards captured 2026-09-04:
 *
 *     Big River      "Corn"          futures "Sep 26 Corn"
 *     Berthold       "Wheat (Hrs)"   futures "Dec 26 MIAX Spring Wheat"
 *     Dakota Midland "Spring Wheat"  futures "Dec 26 MIAX Spring Wheat"
 *
 * A row whose futures column says Corn is a corn row, whatever the left-hand
 * column abbreviates it to. That is a reading off this board on this day.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES, because two families of platform write it differently: this one
 * writes a description, and DTN and Bushel write a symbol (ZCZ26). Both are
 * tried, the description through the SAME matchBand() the commodity name goes
 * through -- so the same substring rules and the same `rice` exception apply,
 * rather than a second matcher that drifts from the first.
 *
 * UNANIMITY, AND LAST. Every row of the commodity must point at one answer: a
 * board that quotes two contracts under one name is saying the name covers two
 * things, and banding both by one of them is how a wrong number publishes.
 * And this is the LAST thing tried -- the source's own bands win, the per-ton
 * KNOWN_UNBANDED list still withholds, and a name that matches a default still
 * matches it. Nothing that worked before reaches this code at all.
 *
 * AND ONLY FOR AN ABBREVIATION, WHICH IS THE ONLY THING IT WAS FOR.
 *
 * The first cut of this had no such limit and it took down two guards that
 * have stood since August: "an UNKNOWN commodity is withheld and named, never
 * dropped in silence", and "a board with nothing publishable is refused". A
 * fixture posts a commodity called ZORBLAX against a corn futures column, and
 * this happily published it as corn.
 *
 * That is a defensible reading -- a band catches a misplaced decimal point,
 * it is not a taxonomy -- and it is still the wrong trade. Those guards exist
 * so that a board carrying something nobody here understands SAYS SO instead
 * of publishing under a borrowed range. ZORBLAX is a word. Yc, Ysb, Hww, Sor
 * and Bly are not words; they are too short to be one, which is what makes
 * them abbreviations and what makes the next column the place to look.
 *
 * So: one token, four characters or fewer. Everything longer keeps the older

 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A FIT. The two hypotheses are a hundred
 * apart, which is three orders of magnitude past any residual a bid board can
 * produce. Measured across the twelve captured cashbidssingle boards: under
 * the RIGHT hypothesis the worst residual is 0.75c, under the WRONG one the
 * best is 521c and the worst is 119,418c. Nothing sits between. That is why
 * this can be read off a board at all, and it is the same argument
 * `futuresScale` above already makes for declaring the field by hand.
 *
 * WHY THE WIDTH IS ONE CENT, and not a number chosen because it worked. These
 * boards display cash and basis rounded to two decimals. Two decimals of a
 * dollar is half a cent of slack on each, so a row whose columns are all
 * correct can still be a full cent out on display alone. One cent is that
 * bound; the widest residual actually observed is 0.75c, on Hillsdale's
 * January corn. Anything past a cent is not display rounding and this does not
 * claim to explain it.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO SAY. Rows that fail under BOTH hypotheses carry no
 * information about the column's units -- Berthold's canola is quoted per
 * tonne against a per-hundredweight cash bid and is out by 70,000c whichever
 * unit you read the column in. Those rows are set aside, and the fact that
 * they were is returned, because a caller that acts on `dollars` without
 * seeing `unexplained: 3` would be acting on a board that still has something
 * badly wrong with it. A unit is only stated when ONE hypothesis explains
 * every row the other left over and the other explains NONE of them.
 *
 * DECLARING THE UNIT CANNOT PUBLISH A WRONG NUMBER. Everything downstream is
 * unchanged: scaleFutures still applies the declared scale, and checkIdentity
 * still has to pass afterwards. Get this wrong and the board refuses exactly
 * as it refuses today. */

   * working. But look at what the identity check did with the same row:
   *
   *     cash - basis  ==  -0.3075 - (-0.3075)  ==  0  ==  futures
   *
   * It PASSED. The one guard whose whole job is proving a number came out of
   * the right column is satisfied by any row where all three values are zero
   * or where cash and basis are the same number. A zero quote turns it into
   * 0 == 0 and it verifies nothing at all.
   *
   * So a zero futures quote is treated as a MISSING quote, everywhere, on
   * every platform -- not as a value. The row is withheld, named in the file,
   * and never counted as verified. It is not a refusal on its own: an expired
   * contract sitting on a board next to live ones is ordinary, and taking the
   * whole source down for it would lose the good rows too. If EVERY row is
   * like this there is nothing left to publish and the source refuses. */
  /* A QUOTE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S UNIT AND SOMEBODY ELSE'S CURRENCY -- 2026-08-26.
   *
   * CHS Ag Services at Hallock and Oklee post canola beside their corn and
   * beans. The cash figure is US dollars per hundredweight, 23.96. The quote
   * beside it is RSX26 -- ICE Canada canola -- in CANADIAN DOLLARS PER TONNE,
   * 789.70. The identity check dutifully compared them and reported the board
   * out by 70,574 cents, ten rows of ten, every half hour.
   *
   * That number is not evidence of a moved column. It is the guard being asked
   * a question that has no answer: cash minus basis cannot equal a futures
   * quote when the three are not in the same unit, let alone the same money.
   * Widening a tolerance to cover seven hundred dollars would destroy the
   * check for every other row on the board; there is no tolerance between
   * "a tick" and "a different currency" that means anything.
   *
   * So such a row is WITHHELD, by the same doctrine that already governs an
   * expired zero quote and an unbanded commodity: it does not publish, because
   * nothing unverifiable ever publishes, and it does not vanish, because a row
   * that is silently absent is indistinguishable from one that was never
   * posted. The cash bid is real -- it is simply not a number this system can
   * prove, and proving it is the whole job.
   *
   * Declared per source as `foreignQuote`, a list of futures-symbol prefixes.
   * It is self-checking in the same way `futuresUnits` is: name a prefix that
   * is really in the board's own unit and those rows stop being verified,
   * which shows up as a drop in the verified count, never as a false pass. */
  /* A UNIT NOTE IN THE DELIVERY COLUMN IS THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A DIFFERENT
   * ADDRESS -- 2026-08-29.
   *
   * Border Ag & Energy post two rows across all six of their towns labelled
   * "Price X2 for CWT". That is the operator telling a reader the figure is per
   * hundredweight and has to be doubled; the futures quote beside it is not.
   * The identity check compared them and reported the board out by 82,486
   * cents -- the same shape, and the same non-answer, as the CHS canola case
   * above.
   *
   * `foreignQuote` is exactly the right doctrine for it and could not express
   * it, because it only ever looked at `b.futures`. On Grain Desk that field is
   * a MONTH NAME ("November 2026"), not a symbol, so there is no prefix that
   * names those rows and no prefix that would not also catch every November
   * corn row on the board.
   *
   * So the same declared list is now matched against the delivery label and the
   * commodity as well. It stays self-checking in the same way: name something
   * that is really in the board's own unit and those rows stop being verified,
   * which shows up as a drop in the verified count and never as a false pass.

  /* WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAID, AND WHAT CHANGED BECAUSE OF IT.
   *
   * Three runs failed on 2026-08-18 with identical numbers hours apart, which
   * a random mid-update read does not do. The log was widened to print every
   * failing row with its contract month, and the answer was unambiguous:
   *
   *     August     Sep 26   4.1125 - (-0.52) -> 463.25c but quoted 463c
   *     September  Sep 26   4.1725 - (-0.46) -> 463.25c but quoted 463c
   *     5 of 7 row(s) balanced.
   *
   * Every failure on the front month; every deferred month exact, including
   * ones carrying quarter cents. So their Sep 26 futures cell lags its own
   * cash by a tick, and it does not clear within a minute -- retrying was not
   * going to fix it, and refusing the whole board meant both sites going dark
   * in fourteen hours over a quarter of a cent on a column that is only there
   * to be checked against.
   *
   * THE RULE NOW, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SOFTENING.
   *
   * The identity check exists to prove a number came out of the right COLUMN.
   * A column shift moves every row by tens of cents, because cash, basis and
   * a futures quote hold numbers of completely different sizes. So:
   *
   *   - any row out by more than a tick or two  -> refuse, columns have moved
   *   - failures in the majority                -> refuse, nothing is proven
   *   - no row exact at all                     -> refuse, nothing is proven
   *   - otherwise                               -> the rows that balanced
   *                                                EXACTLY prove the columns,
   *                                                and the odd row out by a
   *                                                tick is their display
   *
   * The rows that pass are what does the proving, and they still have to pass
   * exactly. Nothing here lets a wrong column through: it takes a majority of
   * rows agreeing to the cent before a single tick-sized disagreement is
   * tolerated, and the row that disagreed is marked so nothing downstream can
   * quote its futures figure as verified. */
  /* DISPLAY PRECISION IS A PROPERTY OF THE SOURCE, NOT A REASON TO LOOSEN THE GUARD.
   *
   * The proof above rests on rows balancing EXACTLY. That works when a board
   * posts cash at the same resolution its futures move at. Boyceville does:
   * 4.5375 against a quarter-cent grid, and its rows balance to the cent.
   *
   * A board that rounds cash to two decimals cannot. Flash Grain posts
   * soybeans at 11.37 when the arithmetic says 11.3725, so every bean row sits
   * a quarter-cent off for ever. Two of its four rows are beans, the failures
   * were therefore never a minority, and a perfectly good board was refused.
   *
   * `cashRoundingCents` declares how much residual that source's own display
   * precision can account for. Rows inside it are not failures — their gap
   * carries no information about column integrity, so counting them dilutes
   * the proof rather than strengthening it.
   *
   * This does NOT weaken the check. A moved column shows up as tens of cents,
   * because cash, basis and a futures quote hold numbers of different sizes;
   * no rounding tolerance reaches that far. It stays 0 for Boyceville, so
   * nothing about the first source changes. And it is declared per source in
   * the manifest, which means adding it is a deliberate act with a reason. */
